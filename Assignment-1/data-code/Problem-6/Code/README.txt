In this directory, the following files are provided.

 1. SVM_learner.m  -  (Template) This function is used to learn a SVM model given training data and SVM parameters (C, r)
 2. SVM_classifier.m - (Template) This function is used to predict the label of a new test instance based on the model learnt using SVM_learner.m
 3. compute_kernel.m - This function computes the kernel function given two vectors (or matrices)
 4. decision_boundary_SVM.m - This function plots the decision boundary given the training samples with respect to the SVM classifier learnt using SVM_learner.m
 5. classification_error.m  - This functions computes the classification error given the predicted and true labels.
 
Use the quadprog MATLAB function for solving the SVM (dual) optimization problem.
